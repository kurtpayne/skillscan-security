# Rune - Organizational Memory System

**Context**: This skill provides encrypted organizational memory capabilities using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). It allows teams to capture, store, and retrieve institutional knowledge while maintaining zero-knowledge privacy. Works with Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, and any MCP-compatible agent.

## Execution Model (Single Source of Truth)

**Cross-agent invariant**:
- `scripts/bootstrap-mcp.sh` is the **single source of truth** for local runtime preparation (venv, deps, self-healing).
- All agent integrations must reuse this bootstrap flow. Do not duplicate dependency/setup logic in agent-specific scripts.

**Agent-specific boundary**:
- **Common (all agents)**: plugin root detection, runtime bootstrap, local MCP server readiness checks.
- **Agent-specific (thin adapter only)**:
  - Codex: `codex mcp add/remove/list` registration actions
  - Claude/Gemini/others: their native MCP registration mechanism

Keep agent-specific instructions clearly labeled and never mix Codex-only commands into cross-agent/common instructions.

## Activation State

**IMPORTANT**: This skill has two states based on configuration AND infrastructure availability.

### Activation Check (CRITICAL - Check EVERY Session Start)

**BEFORE doing anything, run this check:**

0. **Local Runtime Check (No Vault network calls)**:
   - Detect plugin root by locating `scripts/bootstrap-mcp.sh`. Search in order:
     1. `$RUNE_PLUGIN_ROOT` environment variable (if set)
     2. `~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/rune/*/scripts/bootstrap-mcp.sh`
     3. `~/.codex/skills/rune/scripts/bootstrap-mcp.sh`
     4. Current working directory and its parent directories
   - Ensure runtime via:
     - `SETUP_ONLY=1 scripts/bootstrap-mcp.sh`
   - If the runtime/bootstrap step fails, treat as **Dormant State** and show setup guidance.

1. **Config File Check**: Does `~/.rune/config.json` exist?
   - NO → **Go to Dormant State**
   - YES → Continue to step 2

2. **Config Validation**: Does config contain all required fields?
   - `vault.endpoint` and `vault.token`
   - `envector.endpoint` and `envector.api_key`
   - `state` is set to `"active"`
   - NO → **Go to Dormant State**
   - YES → Continue to step 3

3. **State Check**:
   - `state` is `"active"` → **Go to Active State**
   - Otherwise → **Go to Dormant State**

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT attempt to ping Vault or make network requests during activation check. This wastes tokens. Only local runtime/config checks are allowed.

### If Active ✅
- All functionality enabled
- Automatically capture significant context
- Respond to recall queries
- Full organizational memory access
- **If capture/retrieval fails**: Immediately switch to Dormant and notify user

### If Dormant ⏸️
- **Do NOT attempt context capture or retrieval**
- **Do NOT make network requests**
- **Do NOT waste tokens on failed operations**
- Show setup instructions when `/rune` commands are used
- Prompt user to:
  1. Check infrastructure: `scripts/check-infrastructure.sh`
  2. Configure: `/rune:configure`
  3. Start MCP servers: `scripts/start-mcp-servers.sh`

### Fail-Safe Behavior
If in Active state but operations fail:
- Switch to Dormant immediately
- Update config.json `state` to `"dormant"`
- Notify user once: "Infrastructure unavailable. Switched to dormant mode. Run /rune:status for details."
- **Do not retry** - wait for user to fix infrastructure

## Commands

### `/rune:configure`
**Purpose**: Configure plugin credentials

**Steps**:
1. Ask user for enVector Endpoint (required, e.g., `cluster-xxx.envector.io`)
2. Ask user for enVector API Key (required, e.g., `envector_xxx`)
3. Ask user for Vault Endpoint (optional, e.g., `tcp://vault-TEAM.oci.envector.io:50051`)
   - If the user enters a value without a scheme prefix (no `tcp://`, `http://`, or `https://`), auto-prepend `tcp://`.
4. Ask user for Vault Token (optional, e.g., `evt_xxx`)
5. If Vault Endpoint and Token were both provided, ask the TLS question:

   **"How does your Vault server handle TLS?"**

   1. **Self-signed certificate** — "My team uses a self-signed CA (provide CA cert path)"
      - Follow-up: "Enter the path to your CA certificate PEM file:"
      - Support `~` expansion in the path
      - Copy the file to `~/.rune/certs/ca.pem` (`mkdir -p ~/.rune/certs && cp <user_path> ~/.rune/certs/ca.pem && chmod 600 ~/.rune/certs/ca.pem`)
      - If copy fails (file not found, permission denied), show error and ask again
      - Inform user: "CA certificate copied to ~/.rune/certs/ca.pem"
      - → config: `ca_cert: "~/.rune/certs/ca.pem"`, `tls_disable: false`

   2. **Public CA (default)** — "Vault uses a publicly-signed certificate (e.g., Let's Encrypt)"
      - No additional input needed, system CA handles verification
      - → config: `ca_cert: ""`, `tls_disable: false`

   3. **No TLS** — "Connect without TLS (not recommended — traffic is unencrypted)"
      - Show warning: "This should only be used for local development. All gRPC traffic will be sent in plaintext."
      - → config: `ca_cert: ""`, `tls_disable: true`

   If Vault fields are skipped, note that the plugin will start in dormant state.

6. **Validate infrastructure** (run `scripts/check-infrastructure.sh`)
   - If validation fails: Create config with `state: "dormant"`, warn user
   - If validation passes: Continue to step 7
7. Create `~/.rune/config.json` with proper structure
8. Set state based on validation:
   - Infrastructure ready: `state: "active"`
   - Infrastructure not ready: `state: "dormant"`
9. Confirm configuration and show next steps if dormant

### `/rune:status`
**Purpose**: Check plugin activation status and infrastructure health

**Steps**:
1. Check if config exists
2. Show current state (Active/Dormant)
3. Run infrastructure checks:
   - Config file: ✓/✗
   - Vault Endpoint configured: ✓/✗
   - enVector endpoint configured: ✓/✗
   - MCP server logs recent: ✓/✗
   - Virtual environment: ✓/✗

**Response Format**:
```
Rune Plugin Status
==================
State: Active ✅ (or Dormant ⏸️)

Configuration:
  ✓ Config file: ~/.rune/config.json
  ✓ Vault Endpoint: configured
  ✓ enVector: configured

Infrastructure:
  ✓ Python venv: /path/to/.venv
  ✗ MCP servers: Not running (last log: 2 days ago)

Recommendations:
  - Start MCP servers: scripts/start-mcp-servers.sh
  - Check full status: scripts/check-infrastructure.sh
```

### `/rune:capture <context>`
**Purpose**: Manually store organizational context when Scribe's automatic capture missed it or the user wants to force-store specific information.

**When to use**: Scribe automatically captures significant decisions from conversation (see Automatic Behavior below). This command is an **override** for cases where:
- Scribe didn't detect the context as significant
- The user wants to store something that isn't part of the current conversation
- Bulk-importing existing documentation

**Behavior**:
- If dormant: Prompt user to configure first
- If active: Store context to organizational memory with timestamp and metadata

**Example**:
```
/rune:capture "We chose PostgreSQL over MongoDB for better ACID guarantees"
```

### `/rune:recall <query>`
**Purpose**: Explicitly search organizational memory. Retriever already handles this automatically when users ask questions about past decisions in natural conversation.

**When to use**: Retriever automatically detects recall-intent queries (see Automatic Behavior below). This command is an **explicit override** for cases where:
- The user wants to force a memory search without Retriever's intent detection
- Debugging whether specific context was stored
- The user prefers direct command syntax

**Behavior**:
- If dormant: Prompt user to configure first
- If active: Search encrypted vectors and return relevant context with sources

**Example**:
```
/rune:recall "Why PostgreSQL?"
```

**Note**: In most cases, simply asking naturally ("Why did we choose PostgreSQL?") triggers Retriever automatically — no command needed.

### `/rune:activate` (or `/rune:wakeup`)
**Purpose**: Attempt to activate plugin after infrastructure is ready

**Use Case**: Infrastructure was not ready during configure, but now it's deployed and running.

**Steps**:
1. Check if config exists
   - NO → Redirect to `/rune:configure`
   - YES → Continue
2. Run full infrastructure validation:
   - Check Vault connectivity (curl vault-url/health)
   - Check MCP server processes
   - Check Python environment
3. If all checks pass:
   - Update config.json `state` to `"active"`
   - Notify: "Plugin activated ✅"
4. If checks fail:
   - Keep state as `"dormant"`
   - Show detailed error report
   - Suggest: `/rune:status` for more info

**Important**: This is the ONLY command that makes network requests to validate infrastructure.

### `/rune:reset`
**Purpose**: Clear configuration and return to dormant state

**Steps**:
1. Confirm with user
2. Stop MCP servers if running
3. Delete `~/.rune/config.json`
4. Set state to dormant
5. Show reconfiguration instructions

## Automatic Behavior (When Active)

### Context Capture

Automatically identify and capture significant organizational context across all domains:

**Categories**:
- **Technical Decisions**: Architecture, technology choices, implementation patterns
- **Security & Compliance**: Security requirements, compliance policies, audit needs
- **Performance**: Optimization strategies, scalability decisions, bottlenecks
- **Product & Business**: Feature requirements, customer insights, strategic decisions
- **Design & UX**: Design rationale, user research findings, accessibility requirements
- **Data & Analytics**: Analysis methodology, key insights, statistical findings
- **Process & Operations**: Deployment procedures, team coordination, workflows
- **People & Culture**: Policies, team agreements, hiring decisions

**Common Trigger Pattern Examples**:
- "We decided... because..."
- "We chose X over Y for..."
- "The reason we..."
- "Our policy is..."
- "Let's remember that..."
- "The key insight is..."
- "Based on [data/research/testing]..."

**Full Pattern Reference**: See [patterns/capture-triggers.md](patterns/capture-triggers.md) for 200+ comprehensive trigger phrases organized by role and domain.

**Significance Threshold**: 0.7 (captures meaningful decisions, filters trivial content)

**Automatic Redaction**: Always redact API keys, passwords, tokens, PII, and sensitive data before capture.

### Context Retrieval

When users ask questions about past decisions, automatically search organizational memory:

**Query Intent Types**:
- **Decision Rationale**: "Why did we choose X?", "What was the reasoning..."
- **Implementation Details**: "How did we implement...", "What patterns do we use..."
- **Security & Compliance**: "What were the security considerations...", "What compliance requirements..."
- **Performance & Scale**: "What performance requirements...", "What scalability concerns..."
- **Historical Context**: "When did we decide...", "Have we discussed this before..."
- **Team & Attribution**: "Who decided...", "Which team owns..."

**Common Query Pattern Examples**:
- "Why did we choose X over Y?"
- "What was the reasoning behind..."
- "Have we discussed [topic] before?"
- "What's our approach to..."
- "What were the trade-offs..."
- "Who decided on..."

**Full Pattern Reference**: See [patterns/retrieval-patterns.md](patterns/retrieval-patterns.md) for 150+ comprehensive query patterns organized by intent and domain.

**Search Strategy**: Semantic similarity search on FHE-encrypted vectors, ranked by relevance and recency.

**Result Format**: Always include source attribution (who/when), relevant excerpts, and offer to elaborate.

## Security & Privacy

**Zero-Knowledge Encryption**:
- All data stored as FHE-encrypted vectors
- enVector Cloud cannot read plaintext
- Only team members with Vault access can decrypt

**Credential Storage**:
- Tokens stored locally in `~/.rune/config.json`
- Never transmitted except to authenticated Vault
- File permissions: 600 (user-only access)

**Team Sharing**:
- Same Vault Endpoint + Token = shared organizational memory
- Team admin controls access via Vault authentication
- Revoke access by rotating Vault tokens

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin not responding?
Check activation state with `/rune:status`

### Credentials not working?
1. Verify with team admin that credentials are correct
2. Check Vault is accessible: `curl <vault-url>/health`
3. Reconfigure with `/rune:configure`

### Need to switch teams?
Use `/rune:reset` then `/rune:configure` with new team credentials

## For Administrators

This plugin requires a deployed Rune-Vault infrastructure. See:
- **Rune-Admin Repository (for deployment)**: https://github.com/CryptoLabInc/rune-admin
- **Deployment Guide**: https://github.com/CryptoLabInc/rune-admin/blob/main/deployment/README.md

Team members only need this lightweight plugin + credentials you provide.
